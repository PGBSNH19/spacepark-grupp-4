# This is Steps that we need to doo

## Cloud part
-   CI/CD
-   Deployment
-   Hosting
-   Cost
-   Backup
-   Security
-   Scalability
-   Integration tests
-   Monitoring

### Important (Cloud Solution Part)
-   Automation using:
-       Containers
-       IaC (Pulumi)
-       Scripts (preferable PowerShell)


## Application
-   Two different projects (but using same sln)
-   Starwars WebAPI
-   RestSharp (for querying API)


## Technology stack
-   All hosting should be within Microsoft Azure.
-   All projects should be .NET Core
-   Code and documentation should be in GitHub
-   Pipelines should be configured in Azure DevOps, sadly the free limit is 5 users per Azure Devops project.
